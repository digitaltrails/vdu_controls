<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> is a control-panel for DisplayPort, DVI,
HDMI, or USB connected VDUs. Out of the box, <code>vdu_controls</code>
offers a subset of controls including brightness, contrast and audio
controls. Additional controls can be enabled via the
<code>Settings</code> dialog.</p>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> interacts with VDUs by using
<code>ddcutil</code> to issue standard VESA <em>Virtual Control
Panel</em> (<em>VCP</em>) commands via the VESA <em>Display Data
Channel</em> (<em>DDC</em>). <code>Ddcutil</code> provides a robust
interface that is tolerant of the vagaries of the many OEM DDC
implementations.</p>
<p>From <code>vdu_controls 2.0</code> onward, <code>vdu_controls</code>
defaults to using the <code>D-Bus ddcutil-service</code>. Should the
<code>ddcutil-service</code> be unavailable, <code>vdu_controls</code>
will fall back to running the <code>ddcutil</code> command to perform
each request.</p>
<p>The UI’s look-and-feel dynamically adjusts to dark and light themes.
The application may optionally run in the system tray of KDE, Deepin,
GNOME, and Xfce (and possibly others).</p>
<p>The UI provides an optional <code>ambient-light slider</code> for
simultaneously adjusting all VDUs according to custom per-VDU ambient
lux/brightness profiles. Options are included for automated adjustment
by accessing a hardware light-meters, webcams, or other devices.</p>
<p>Named <code>Preset</code> configurations can be saved and recalled.
For example, presets may be created for night, day, photography, movies,
and so forth. Presets can be triggered by specific ambient light levels,
scheduled according to local solar elevation, vetoed by local weather
conditions, or activated by UNIX signals.</p>
<p>From any UI window, <code>F1</code> accesses help, and
<code>F10</code> accesses the main-menu. The main-menu is also available
via the hamburger-menu, and also via the right-mouse button in either
the main-window or the system-tray icon. The main-menu has
<code>ALT-key</code> shortcuts for all menu items (subject to sufficient
letters being available to distinguish all user defined presets).</p>
<p>For further information, including screenshots, see
https://github.com/digitaltrails/vdu_controls .</p>
<p>The long term affects of repeatably rewriting a VDUs setting are not
well understood, but some concerns have been expressed. See
<strong>LIMITATIONS</strong> for further details.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>Configuration changes can be made via the <code>Settings</code>
dialog or by editing the config-files.</p>
<h2 id="settings-menu-and-config-files">Settings Menu and Config
files</h2>
<p>The <code>Settings</code> dialog features a tab for editing
common/default settings as well as tabs specific to each VDU. The config
files are named according to the following scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application wide default config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf</code></li>
<li>VDU model and serial number config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;_&lt;serial|display_num&gt;.conf</code></li>
<li>VDU model only config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;.conf</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The VDU-specific config files can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct manufacturer built-in metadata.</li>
<li>Customise which controls are to be provided for each VDU.</li>
<li>Define a user-friendly label for each VDU.</li>
<li>Set optimal <code>ddcutil</code> DDC parameters for each VDU.</li>
</ul>
<p>The config files are in INI-format divided into a number of sections
as outlined below::</p>
<pre><code>[vdu-controls-globals]
# The vdu-controls-globals section is only required in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf
system-tray-enabled = yes|no
splash-screen-enabled = yes|no
translations-enabled = yes|no
weather-enabled = yes|no
schedule-enabled = yes|no
lux-options-enabled = yes|no
warnings-enabled = yes|no
debug-enabled = yes|no
syslog-enabled = yes|no

[vdu-controls-widgets]
# Yes/no for each of the control options that vdu_controls normally provides by default.
brightness = yes|no
contrast = yes|no
audio-volume = yes|no
audio-mute = yes|no
audio-treble = yes|no
audio-bass = yes|no
audio-mic-volume = yes|no
input-source = yes|no
power-mode = yes|no
osd-language = yes|no

# Enable ddcutil supported codes not enabled in vdu_controls by default, CSV list of two-digit hex values.
enable-vcp-codes = NN, NN, NN

# User friendly VDU name
vdu_label = My Main Monitor (on the right)

[ddcutil-parameters]
# Useful values appear to be &gt;=0.1
sleep-multiplier = 0.5

[ddcutil-capabilities]
# The (possibly edited) output from &quot;ddcutil --display N capabilities&quot; with leading spaces retained.
capabilities-override =</code></pre>
<p>Config files can only be used to enable and alter definitions of VCP
codes supported by <code>ddcutil</code>. Unsupported manufacturer
specific features should only be experimented with caution, some may
have irreversible consequences, including bricking the hardware.</p>
<p>As well as using the <code>Settings</code>, config files may also be
created by the command line option::</p>
<pre><code>vdu_controls --create-config-files</code></pre>
<p>which will create initial templates based on the currently connected
VDUs.</p>
<p>The config files are completely optional, they need not be used if
the default options are found to be adequate.</p>
<h2
id="adding-value-restrictions-to-a-vdus-capabilities-override">Adding
value restrictions to a VDU’s capabilities override</h2>
<p>In some cases, a VDU’s DDC reported minimums and maximums may be
incorrect or overstated. Within vdu_controls this can be corrected by
overriding the DDC reported range. For example, perhaps a VDU reports it
supports a brightness range of 0 to 100, but in fact only practically
supports 20 to 90. This can be corrected by bringing up the VDU’s
settings tab and editing the text in the <strong>capabilities
override</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <em>Settings</em> tab for the VDU, navigate to the
“capabilities override* field</li>
<li>locate the feature, in this example, the brightness,</li>
<li>add a <strong>Values:</strong> <strong>min..max</strong>
specification to line the following the feature definition,</li>
<li>save the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the brightness example the completed edit would look like::</p>
<pre><code>Feature: 10 (Brightness)
    Values: 20..80</code></pre>
<p>The vdu_controls slider for that value will now be restricted to the
specified range.</p>
<h2
id="adding-a-refreshreload-requirement-to-a-vdus-capabilities-override">Adding
a refresh/reload requirement to a VDU’s capabilities override</h2>
<p>Altering the values of some VCP codes may result in a cascade of
changes to other codes. For example, changing a VCP value for
<em>Picture Mode</em> might result in changes to several VCP-code
features, including brightness, contrast, and others. Exactly which
codes have these kinds of side effects isn’t indicated in the metadata
obtained from each VDU, however vdu_controls supports adding
<em>refresh</em> annotations to the feature-names within the
<strong>capabilities override</strong>. For example::</p>
<pre><code>Feature: 15 (Picture Mode)</code></pre>
<p>Can be annotated with::</p>
<pre><code>Feature: 15 (Picture Mode *refresh*)</code></pre>
<p>With this annotation, when ever <em>Picture Mode</em> is altered,
vdu_controls will reload all configuration files and refresh all control
values from the VDUs.</p>
<h2 id="dbus-dccutil-service">DBUS dccutil-service</h2>
<p>When available, <code>vdu_controls</code> defaults to interacting
with VDUs via the DBUS <code>ddcutil-service</code> service rather than
the <code>ddcutil</code> command. The service should be both faster and
more reliable - noticeably so when multiple VDUs need to be controlled.
Whether to use the service can be controlled by the
<code>DBUS client</code> checkbox in the settings dialog.</p>
<p>When using the service, you may optionally enable service detection
of DPMS events and VDU connectivity events (hot-plugging cables or
power-cycling VDUs). Whether to enable events is controlled by the
<code>DBUS events</code> checkbox in the settings dialog. The
reliability and timeliness of events may vary depending on the model of
GPU, version of GPU driver, model of VDU, and type of VDU
connector-cable. In some cases the service polling for DPMS or
connection status may wake some VDU models. Both
<code>ddcutil-service</code> or <code>libddcutil</code> offer options
for finer control over which events are detected and how.</p>
<h2 id="presets">Presets</h2>
<p>A named <em>Preset</em> can be used to save the current VDU settings
for later recall. Any number of presets can be created for different
lighting conditions or different applications, for example:
<em>Night</em>, <em>Day</em>, <em>Overcast</em>, <em>Sunny</em>,
<em>Photography</em>, and <em>Video</em>. Each presets can be assigned a
name and icon.</p>
<p>The <code>Presets</code> item in <code>main-menu</code> will bring up
a <code>Presets</code> dialog for managing and applying presets. The
<code>main-menu</code> also includes an item for each existing
preset.</p>
<p>Any small SVG or PNG can be assigned as a preset’s icon. Monochrome
SVG icons that conform to the Plasma color conventions will be
automatically inverted if the desktop them is changed from dark to
light. If a preset lacks an icon, an icon will be created from the
initials of the first and last words of its name. A starter set of icons
is included in <code>/usr/share/vdu_controls/icons/</code>.</p>
<p>Any time the current VDUs settings match those of a preset, the
preset’s name and icon will automatically show in the window-title, tray
tooltip, tray icon.</p>
<p>Presets may be set to transition immediately (the default); gradually
on schedule (solar elevation); or gradually always (when triggered by
schedule, main-menu, or UNIX signal). The speed of transition is
determined by how quickly each VDU can respond to adjustment. During a
transition, the transition will be abandoned if the controls involved in
the transition are altered by any other activity.</p>
<p>Each preset is stored in config directory as:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/Preset_&lt;preset_name&gt;.conf</code></p>
<p>Preset files are saved in INI-file format for ease of editing. Each
preset file contains a section for each connected VDU, for example::</p>
<pre><code>[preset]
icon = /usr/share/icons/breeze/status/16/cloudstatus.svg
solar-elevation = eastern-sky 40
transition-type = scheduled
transition-step-interval-seconds = 5

[HP_ZR24w_CNT008]
brightness = 50
osd-language = 02

[LG_HDR_4K_89765]
brightness = 13
audio-speaker-volume = 16</code></pre>
<p>When creating a preset file, you may select which controls to save
for each VDU. For example, you might create a preset that includes the
brightness, but not the contrast or audio-volume. Keeping the included
controls to a minimum speeds up the transition and reduces the chances
of the VDU failing to keep up with the associated stream of DDC
commands.</p>
<p>While using the GUI to create or edit a preset, activation of
scheduled presets and adjustments due to light-metering are blocked
until editing is complete.</p>
<h2 id="presets---vdu-initialization-presets">Presets - VDU
initialization-presets</h2>
<p>For a VDU named <code>abc</code> with a serial number
<code>xyz</code>, if a preset named <code>abx xyz</code> exists, that
preset will be restored at startup or when ever the VDU is subsequently
detected.</p>
<p>This feature is designed to restore settings that cannot be saved in
the VDU’s NVRAM or for VDUs where the NVRAM capacity has been exhausted
or is faulty.</p>
<h2 id="presets---solar-elevation-triggers">Presets - solar elevation
triggers</h2>
<p>A preset may be set to automatically trigger when the sun rises to a
specified elevation. The idea being to allow a preset to trigger
relative to dawn or dusk, or when the sun rises above some surrounding
terrain (the time of which will vary as the seasons change).</p>
<p>If a preset has an elevation, the preset will be triggered each day
at a time calculated according to the latitude and longitude specified
by in the <code>vdu-controls-globals</code> <code>location</code>
option. By choosing an appropriate <code>solar-elevation</code> a preset
may be confined to specific times of the year. For example, a preset
with a positive solar elevation will not trigger at mid-winter in the
Arctic circle (because the sun never gets that high). Any preset may be
manually invoked regardless of its specified solar elevations.</p>
<p>To assign a trigger, use the Preset Dialog to set a preset’s
<code>solar-elevation</code>. A solar elevation may range from -19
degrees in the eastern sky (morning/ascending) to -19 degrees in the
western sky (afternoon/descending), with a maximum nearing 90 degrees at
midday.</p>
<p>On any given day, the Preset Dialog may be used to temporarily
override any trigger, in which case the trigger is suspended until the
following day. For example, a user might choose to disable a trigger
intended for the brightest part of the day if the day is particularly
dull.</p>
<p>At startup <code>vdu_controls</code> will restore the most recent
preset that would have been triggered for this day (if any). For
example, say a user has <code>vdu_controls</code> set to run at login,
and they’ve also set a preset to trigger at dawn, but they don’t
actually log in until just after dawn, the overdue dawn preset will be
triggered at login.</p>
<h2 id="presets---smooth-transitions">Presets - Smooth Transitions</h2>
<p><strong>To minimize writes to VDU NVRAM, smooth-transitions have been
deprecated and are disabled by default. To reenable smooth transitions,
uncheck the <code>protect-nvram</code> option in
<em>Settings</em>.</strong></p>
<p>A preset may be set to <code>Smoothly Transition</code>, in which
case changes to controls continuous-value slider controls such as
brightness and contrast will be stepped by one until the final values
are reached. Any non-continuous values will be set after all continuous
values have reached their final values, for example, if input-source is
included in a preset, it will be restored at the end.</p>
<p>The Preset Dialog includes a combo-box for defining when to apply
transitions to a preset:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>None</code> - change immediately;</li>
<li><code>On schedule</code> - slowly change according to a solar
elevation trigger;</li>
<li><code>On signal</code> - slowly change on the appropriate UNIX
signal;</li>
<li><code>On menu</code> - slowly change when selected in the
main-menu;</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally a transition single-steps the controls as quickly as
possible. In practice this means each step takes one or more seconds and
increases linearly depending on the number of VDUs and number of
controls being altered. The Presets Dialog includes a
<code>Transition Step seconds</code> control that can be used to
increase the step interval and extend a transition over a longer period
of time.</p>
<p>If any transitioning controls change independently of the transition,
the transition will cease. In that manner a transition can be abandoned
by dragging a slider or choosing a different preset.</p>
<h2 id="presets---supplementary-weather-requirements">Presets -
supplementary weather requirements</h2>
<p>A solar elevation trigger can have a weather requirement which will
be checked against the weather reported by https://wttr.in.</p>
<p>By default, there are three possible weather requirements:
<code>good</code>, <code>bad</code>, and <code>all weather</code>. Each
requirement is defined by a file containing a list of WWO
(https://www.worldweatheronline.com) weather codes, one per line. The
three default requirements are contained in the files
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/{good,bad,all}.weather</code>.
Additional weather requirements can be created by using a text editor to
create further files. The <code>all.weather</code> file exists primarily
as a convenient resource that lists all possible codes.</p>
<p>Because reported current weather conditions may be inaccurate or out
of date, it’s best to use weather requirements as a coarse measure.
Going beyond good and bad may not be very practical. What’s possible
might depend on you local weather conditions.</p>
<p>To ensure <code>wttr.in</code> supplies the weather for your
location, please ensure that <code>Settings</code> <code>Location</code>
includes a place-name suffix. The <code>Settings</code>
<code>Location</code> <code>Detect</code> button has been enhanced to
fill out a place-name for you. Should <code>wttr.in</code> not recognise
a place-name, the place-name can be manually edited to something more
suitable. The nearest big city or an airport-code will do, for example:
LHR, LAX, JFK. You can use a web browser to test a place-name, for
example: https://wttr.in/JFK</p>
<p>When weather requirements are in use, <code>vdu_controls</code> will
check that the coordinates in <code>Settings</code>
<code>Location</code> are a reasonable match for those returned from
<code>wttr.in</code>, a warning will be issued if they are more than 200
km (124 miles) apart.</p>
<p>If the place-name is left blank, the <code>wttr.in</code> server will
try to guess you location from your external IP address. The guess may
not be accurate and may vary over time.</p>
<h2 id="presets---remote-control">Presets - remote control</h2>
<p>Scripts may use UNIX/Linux signals may be used to instruct a running
<code>vdu_controls</code> to invoke a preset or to initiate “Refresh
settings from monitors”. Signals in the range 40 to 55 correspond to
first to last presets (if any are defined). Additionally, SIGHUP can be
used to initiate “Refresh settings from monitors”. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Identify the running vdu_controls (assuming it is installed as /usr/bin/vdu_controls)::

    ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39;

Combine this with kill to trigger a preset change::

    kill -40 $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)
    kill -41 $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)

Or if some other process has changed a VDUs settings, trigger vdu_controls to update its UI::

    kill -HUP $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Any other signals will be handled normally (in many cases they will
result in process termination).</p>
<h2 id="ambient-light-levels-and-lightlux-metering">Ambient Light Levels
and Light/Lux Metering</h2>
<p>The default UI includes an <code>ambient-light slider</code> which
will simultaneously adjust all VDUs according to custom per-VDU
lux/brightness profiles. As well as indicating the ambient light level
manually via the slider, <code>vdu_controls</code> can be configured to
periodically read from a hardware lux metering device and adjust
brightness automatically. The Lux-Dialog provides controls for setting
up light metering and VDU lux/brightness profiles. If ambient light
level controls are not required, the Settings Dialog includes an option
to disable and hide them.</p>
<p>As well as the manual-slider, a metering device may be a
serial-device, a UNIX FIFO (named-pipe), or an executable (script or
program):</p>
<ul>
<li>A serial-device must periodically supply one floating-point
lux-value terminated by a carriage-return newline.</li>
<li>A FIFO must periodically supply one floating-point lux-value
terminated by a newline.</li>
<li>An executable must supply one floating-point lux-value reading
terminated by a newline each time it is run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible hardware devices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Arduino with a GY-30/BH1750 lux meter writing to a usb
serial-port.</li>
<li>A webcam periodically sampled to produce approximate lux values.
Values might be estimated by analysing image content or image settings
that contribute to exposure, such ISO values, apertures, and shutter

<p>Further information on various lux metering options, as well as
instructions for constructing and programming an Arduino with a
GY-30/BH1750, can be found at:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/digitaltrails/vdu_controls/blob/master/Lux-metering.md</code></pre>
<p>Example scripts for mapping a webcam’s average-brightness to
approximate lux values are included in
<code>/usr/share/vdu_controls/sample-scripts/</code> or they can also be
downloaded from the following location:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/digitaltrails/vdu_controls/tree/master/sample-scripts.</code></pre>
<p>The examples include <code>vlux_meter.py</code>, a beta-release
Qt-GUI python-script that meters from a webcam and writes to a FIFO
(<code>$HOME/.cache/vlux_fifo</code>). Controls are included for mapping
image-brightness to lux mappings, and for defining a crop from which to
sample brightness values. The script optionally runs in the
system-tray.</p>
<p>The examples may require customising for your own webcam and lighting
conditions.</p>
<h2 id="lux-metering-and-brightness-transitions">Lux Metering and
brightness transitions</h2>
<p>Due to VDU hardware and DDC protocol limitations, gradual transitions
from one brightness level to another are likely to be noticeable and
potentially annoying. As well as being annoying excessive stepping may
eat into VDU NVRAM lifespan.</p>
<p>The auto-brightness adjustment feature includes several measures to
reduce the number of changes passed to the VDU:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lux/Brightness Profiles may be altered for local conditions so that
brightness levels remain constant over set ranges of lux values (night,
day, and so forth).</li>
<li>Adjustments are only made at intervals of one or more minutes
(default is 10 minutes).</li>
<li>The adjustment task passes lux values through a smoothing low-pass
filter.</li>
<li>A VDU brightness profile may optionally be set to stair-step with no
interpolation of intermediate values.</li>
</ul>
<p>When ambient light conditions are fluctuating, for example, due to
passing clouds, automatic adjust can be manually suspended. The
main-panel, main-menu, and light-metering dialog each contain controls
for toggling Auto/Manual. Additionally, moving the manual lux-slider
turns off automatic adjustment.</p>
<p>The Light-metering dialog includes an option to enable
auto-brightness interpolation. This option will enable the calculation
of values between steps in the profiles. In order to avoid small
fluctuating changes, interpolation won’t result in brightness changes
less than 10%. During interpolation, if a lux value is found to be in
proximity to any attached preset, the preset values will be preferred
over interpolated ones.</p>
<h2 id="lightlux-metering-and-presets">Light/Lux Metering and
Presets</h2>
<p>The Light-Metering Dialog includes the ability to set a Preset to
trigger at a lux value. This feature is accessed by hovering under the
bottom axis of the Lux Profile Chart.</p>
<p>When a preset is tied to a lux value, the preset’s VDU brightness
values become fixed points on the Lux Profile Chart. When the specified
metered lux value is achieved, the stepping process will restore the
preset’s brightness values and then trigger the full restoration of the
preset. This ordering of events reduces the likelihood of
metered-stepping, and preset-restoration from clashing.</p>
<p>A preset that does not include a VDU’s brightness may be attached to
a lux point to restore one or more non-brightness controls. For example,
on reaching a particular lux level, an attached preset might restore a
contrast setting.</p>
<p>If a preset is attached to a lux value and then detached, the
preset’s profile points will be converted to normal (editable) profile
points. Attach/detach is a quick way to copy VDU brightness values from
presets if you don’t want to permanently attach them.</p>
<p>If you utilise light-metered auto-brightness and preset-scheduling
together, their combined effects may conflict. For example, a scheduled
preset may set a reduced brightness, but soon after, light-metering
might increase it. If you wish to use the two together, design your
lux/brightness profile steps to match the brightness levels of specific
presets, for example, a full-sun preset and the matching step in a
lux/brightness Profile might both be assigned the same brightness
level.</p>
<h2 id="lux-metering-internal-parameters">Lux Metering Internal
Parameters</h2>
<p>The following internal constants can be altered by manually editing
<code>~/.config/vdu_controls/AutoLux.conf</code>. They guide the various
metering and auto-adjustment heuristics::</p>
<pre><code>  [lux-meter]
  # How many times per minute to sample from the Lux meter (for auto-adjustment)
  samples-per-minute=3
  # How many samples to include in the smoothing process
  smoother-n=5
  # How heavily should past values smooth the present value (smaller = more smoothing)
  # See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Simple_infinite_impulse_response_filter
  smoother-alpha=0.5
  # If an interpolated value yields a change in brightness, how big should the change
  # be to trigger an actual VDU change in brightness? Also determines how close
  # an interpolated value needs to be to an attached preset&#39;s brightness in order
  # to prefer triggering the preset over applying the interpolated value.
  interpolation-sensitivity-percent=10
  # Jump brightness in one step up to this maximum, after which transition in steps.
  max-brightness-jump=100</code></pre>

id="improving-response-time-dynamic-optimization-and-sleep-multipliers">Improving
Response Time: Dynamic Optimization and Sleep Multipliers</h2>
<p>If you are using <code>ddcutil</code> version 2.0 or greater,
<code>vdu_controls</code> will default to using the <code>ddcutil</code>
<em>dynamic sleep optimiser</em>. The optimiser automatically tunes and
caches VDU specific timings when ever <code>ddcutil</code> is run. Any
reliability-issues or errors may be automatically resolved as the
optimiser refines it’s cached timings. Should problems persist, the
optimiser can be disabled by adding <code>--disable-dynamic-sleep</code>
to the <strong>ddcutil extra arguments</strong> in the <strong>Settings
Dialog</strong> (either globally on the <strong>vdu_controls
tab</strong> or selectively under each VDU’s tab). If dynamic sleep is
disabled, multipliers can then be manually assigned. The optimiser’s
heuristics continue to be refined, it may be that some issues may be
resolved by moving to a more recent version of
<code>libddcutil/ddcutil</code>.</p>
<p>For versions of <code>ddcutil</code> prior to 2.0, you can manually
set the <code>vdu_control</code> <code>sleep-multiplier</code> passed to
<code>ddcutil</code>. A sleep multiplier less than one will speed up the
i2c protocol interactions at the risk of increased protocol errors. The
default sleep multiplier of 1.0 has to be quite conservative, many VDUs
can cope with smaller multipliers. A bit of experimentation with
multiplier values may greatly speed up responsiveness. In a multi-VDU
setup individual sleep multipliers can be configured (see previous
section).</p>
<h2
id="improving-response-time-and-reliability-connections-and-controls">Improving
Response Time and Reliability: Connections and Controls</h2>
<p><code>DDC/I2C</code> is not a totally reliable form of communication.
VDUs may vary in their responsiveness and compliance. GPUs, GPU drivers,
and types of connection may affect the reliability. Both ddcutil and
vdu_controls attempt to manage the reliability by using repetition and
by adjusting timings.</p>
<p>If you have the choice, a <code>DisplayPort</code> to
<code>DisplayPort</code> connection may be more reliable than
<code>DVI</code> or <code>HDMI</code>.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of enabled controls can speed up initialization,
decrease the refresh time, and reduce the time taken to restore
presets.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of useful info for getting the best out of
<code>ddcutil</code> at https://www.ddcutil.com/.</p>
<h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>
<p>Repeatably altering VDU settings might affect VDU lifespan,
exhausting the NVRAM write cycles, stressing the VDU power-supply, or
increasing panel burn-in.</p>
<p>That said, <code>vdu_controls</code> does include a number of
features that can be used to reduce the overall frequency of adjustments
to acceptable levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inbuilt mitigations:
<ul>
<li>Slider and spin-box controls only update the VDU when adjustments
become slow or stop (when no change occurs in 0.5 seconds).</li>
<li>Preset restoration only updates the VDU values that differ from its
current values.</li>
<li>Transitioning smoothly has been disabled by default and deprecated
for version 2.1.0 onward.</li>
<li>Automatic ambient brightness adjustment only triggers a change when
the proposed brightness differs from the current brightness by at least
10%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Electable mitigations:
<ul>
<li>Choose to restore pre-prepared ‘presets’ instead of dragging
sliders.</li>
<li>Refrain from adding transitions to <code>presets</code>.</li>
<li>If using the ambient-light brightness response curves, tune the
settings and curves to minimize frequent small changes.</li>
<li>If using a light-meter, disengage metered automatic adjustment when
faced with rapidly fluctuating levels of ambient brightness.</li>
<li>Consider adjusting the ambient lighting instead of the VDU.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Monitoring to assist with making adjustments:
<ul>
<li>Hovering over a VDU name in the main window reveals a popup that
includes the number of VCP (NVRAM) writes.</li>
<li>The bottom of the About-dialog shows the same numbers. They update
dynamically.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="laptops">Laptops</h2>
<p>Builtin laptop displays normally don’t implement DDC and those
displays are not supported, but a laptop’s externally connected VDUs are
likely to be controllable.</p>
<h2 id="cross-platform-differences">Cross-platform differences</h2>
<p>Wayland doesn’t allow an application to precisely position its
windows. When the <code>smart-window</code> option is enabled, the
application switches it’s underlying platform to XWayland so that the
main window position can be saved and restored.</p>
<p>The UI attempts to step around minor differences between KDE, GNOME,
and the rest, the UI on each may not be exactly the same.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other concerns</h2>
<p>The power-supplies in some older VDUs may buzz/squeel audibly when
the brightness is turned way down. This may not be a major issue
because, in normal surroundings, older VDUs are often not usable below
about 85-90% brightness.</p>
<p>Going beyond the standard DDC features by attempting to experiment
with hidden or undocumented features or values has the potential to make
irreversible changes.</p>
<p>Some controls change the number of connected devices (for example,
some VDUs support a power-off command). If such controls are used,
<code>vdu_controls</code> will detect the change and will reconfigure
the controls for the new situation (for example, DDC VDU 2 may now be
DDC VDU 1). If you change settings independently of
<code>vdu_controls</code>, for example, by using a VDU’s physical
controls, the <code>vdu_controls</code> UI includes a refresh button to
force it to assess the new configuration.</p>
<p>Some VDU settings may disable or enable other settings in the VDU.
For example, setting a VDU to a specific picture-profile might result in
the contrast-control being disabled, but <code>vdu_controls</code> will
not be aware of the restriction resulting in its contrast-control erring
or appearing to do nothing.</p>
<p>If your VDUs support <em>picture-modes</em>, altering any controls in
vdu_controls will most likely result in the picture-mode being
customised. For example, say you have selected the VDU’s <em>Vivid</em>
picture-mode, if you use vdu_controls to change the brightness, it’s
likely that this will now become the brightness for <em>Vivid</em> until
the VDU is reset to its defaults. To avoid confusion, it may be
advisable to stick to one picture-mode for use with vdu_controls,
preserving the others unaltered.</p>
